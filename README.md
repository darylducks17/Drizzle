# Drizzle
This final year project addresses the critical need for promoting healthy hydration practices among adults aged 50
and over through the design of an interactive mobile application, "Drizzle." Recognising the unique
challenges and preferences of this demographic, the application aims to facilitate consistent fluid intake
by providing personalised reminders, tracking functionalities, educational resources, and other
engaging features.

Due to time constraints and unforeseen planning challenges, the initial development focused on
implementing the core functionality of logging fluid intake. The user-centered design approach,
informed by surveys and prototype feedback, ensured the applicationâ€™s ease of use and intuitiveness.

While not all planned features could be realised within the project timeline, the successful
implementation of the core functionality and positive user feedback validate the potential of "Drizzle"
to empower older adults in managing their hydration effectively. Future iterations will focus on
incorporating additional features that have been identified to further enhance user engagement and
promote long-term adherence to healthy hydration practices.

This project contributes to the growing body of research on leveraging technology to promote healthy
aging and demonstrates the potential of mobile applications to address specific health needs of adults
aged 50 and over.
